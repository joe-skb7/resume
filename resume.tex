\section{Summary}
Embedded software engineer with 15+ years of professional experience. For the
last 10+ years have been contributing to open-source projects. Specialize in
Linux kernel, bootloaders, firmware, and system level programming on ARM-based
devices. Have 170+ patches accepted in the upstream Linux kernel, 250+ patches
in U-Boot, and 500+ patches in open-source projects overall. Was a speaker at
10+ conferences worldwide. Have $\sim$15,000 reputation on StackOverflow. A
combination of hard skills in low-level programming, electronics, Linux
ecosystem, and upstreaming enables me to solve complex cross-disciplinary tasks
in the Embedded area.
